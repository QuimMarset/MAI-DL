def full_network_embedding(model, image_paths, batch_size, target_layer_names, input_reshape, stats=None):
    ''' 
    Generates the Full-Network embedding[1] of a list of images using a pre-trained
    model (input parameter model) with its computational graph loaded. Tensors used 
    to compose the FNE are defined by target_tensors input parameter. The input_tensor
    input parameter defines where the input is fed to the model.
    By default, the statistics used to standardize are the ones provided by the same 
    dataset we wish to compute the FNE for. Alternatively these can be passed through
    the stats input parameter.
    This function aims to generate the Full-Network embedding in an illustrative way.
    We are aware that it is possible to integrate everything in a tensorflow operation,
    however this is not our current goal.

    Args:
        model (tf.GraphDef): Serialized TensorFlow protocol buffer (GraphDef) containing the pre-trained model graph
                             from where to extract the FNE. You can get corresponding tf.GraphDef from default Graph
                             using `tf.Graph.as_graph_def`.
        image_paths (list(str)): List of images to generate the FNE for.
        batch_size (int): Number of images to be concurrently computed on the same batch.
        target_layer_names (list(str)): List of tensor names from model to extract features from.
        input_reshape (tuple): A tuple containing the desired shape (height, width) used to resize the image.
        stats (2D ndarray): Array of feature-wise means and stddevs for standardization.
    Returns:
       2D ndarray : List of features per image. Of shape <num_imgs,num_feats>
       2D ndarry: Mean and stddev per feature. Of shape <2,num_feats>
